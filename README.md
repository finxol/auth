# Finxol Auth Server

A lightweight authentication server built with Deno and OpenAuth.

## Overview

This is a minimal auth server implementation designed to be easily forked and customized for your authentication needs.
It leverages OpenAuth for OAuth2 workflows and runs on Deno Deploy for a modern, secure runtime environment.

## Deploy

This auth server can easily be deployed to Deno Deploy by following these steps:

### Fork

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork locally

### Deploy to Deno Deploy

1. Go to Deno Deploy and [create a new project](https://dash.deno.com/new_project).
2. Choose your fork in the GitHub repos list.
3. Make sure to check "Just link the repo, Iâ€™ll set up GitHub Actions myself" as the Actions workflow is already in the repo.
4. In your settings, add the required environment variables.

### Environment Variables

- `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the auth server. Used to authenticate requests provenence.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for the GitHub authentication provider.
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for the GitHub authentication provider.

### Push to deploy

To actually deploy the application, deploy deploy needs a new push to the main branch to trigger the Actions workflow.
This can simply be your configuration changes.

### Configuration

The server is configured through the `config.ts` file at the project root.
Currently, the configurable options are:

- **`allowedOrigins`**: An array of allowed origins. Supports wildcards for subdomains and ports.
- **`title`**: The title of the auth server. Shown on the home page.
- **`description`**: The description of the auth server. Shown on the home page.

Example configuration:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    title: "My Auth Server",
    description: "A custom authentication server",
    allowedOrigins: [
        "http://localhost:*/",
        "https://yourdomain.com",
        "https://*.yourdomain.com/",
    ],
})
```

### (optional) Link a custom domain

You can optionnally link a custom domain name to your auth server in your Deploy settings.
Everything will work normally.
